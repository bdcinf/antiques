Product Display Images</b></p><p
>The delivered item for the respective product categories may/ may not be exact replica of the images shown on the website (depending on the availability of the ordered product). Hence in such a case the delivered product shall be similar/ close-replica to the image shown for the ordered product item.</p>
<p
><b>5.
Out of Stock Items/Back Orders</b></p><p
>Although we try to keep every item in stock, occasionally some items are not immediately available for shipment and may need to be backordered.
Unlike some of our competitors, we allow you to keep backordered items as part of your order until they're available to ship, without incurring any additional shipping charges.
However, in an effort to reduce shipping costs and the environmental impact of extra packaging, any order that contains a backorder where the available products totals less than Rs 1,000/- will be held for up to eight business days before shipping, in the event the backordered item becomes available and can be shipped with the rest of your order. We do this because more than 70% of backordered items normally become available within that timeframe, regardless of the expected availability date listed on our website.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can always request that the product items in your order be shipped separately as they become available.</p>
